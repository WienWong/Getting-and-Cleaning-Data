Ddata that identifies the subject id and the activity:
* Subject  : thirty subjects Identified by
* Activity : six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) are measured.

The signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
