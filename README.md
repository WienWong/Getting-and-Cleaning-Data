## Getting and Cleaning Data

### Purpose of project
The purpose of this project is to clean and tidy data from a raw dataset collected by the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

### Steps to follow 

1. Download the data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

2. Unzip the data into a file under your working directory. You can find folders such as `"test"`, `"train"` etc.

3. Run `"run_analysis.R"` under your working directory.

4.  You should find a new file called `TidyData.txt` in your working directory.


### Required package

The `"reshape2"` package is required to be installed first for running `"run_analysis.R"`.

Please refer to the CodeBook.md for description of the variables. Note that full description of the raw data is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
